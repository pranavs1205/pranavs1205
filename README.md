### ðŸ§  My Skills

Here's a breakdown of my core skills, with a focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

#### Machine Learning

I have hands-on experience with a variety of machine learning concepts and algorithms, including:

- **Supervised Learning**: Linear and Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.
- **Tools & Libraries**: **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

#### Deep Learning

My deep learning skills are centered around building and training neural networks for various applications:

- **Neural Networks**: Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
- **Architectures**: I'm familiar with popular architectures such as ResNet, VGG, and LSTM networks.
- **Frameworks**: **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.
- **Applications**: Image classification, object detection, and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
